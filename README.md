# Photo Sharing App


This full-stack photo-sharing application (inspired by instagram) implements logging-in, logging-out, uploading pictures, commenting, mentioning/tagging other users, etc. Here's a video of testing functionality before implementing front-end aesthetics, https://youtu.be/eoYiUi_SXZU. 

Every feature was developed incrementally, which reinforced my integration and unit-testing skills.

    (1) Single Page Application / Data Retriever from Server

    (2) Appserver and Database

    (3) Sessions and Input

    (4) Implementing Additional Features: Mentions, Tagging, Commenting, Editing Profile, Etc. 

    (5) Testing
